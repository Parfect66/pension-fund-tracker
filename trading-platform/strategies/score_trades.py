Trade Scorer — Improved
========================
Gives each ORB signal a score out of 100 across five factors that
are each independently meaningful on real NQ price data.

WHY THE OLD SCORER WAS REPLACED
--------------------------------
The original four factors had two problems:
  - Risk/reward: stop and target are fixed numbers, so this scored
    identically on almost every trade. It wasn't measuring anything.
  - Range size: compared to the whole-dataset average instead of
    recent volatility, so "tight" had no consistent meaning.

THE FIVE NEW FACTORS (20 pts each = 100 max)
---------------------------------------------
  1. Trend alignment   — does the breakout direction match the trend?
                         (BUY when price has been rising, SELL when falling)
  2. Range vs ATR      — how tight was the range relative to recent volatility?
                         ATR = Average True Range, a standard volatility measure
  3. Breakout strength — did price close convincingly beyond the range,
                         or barely scratch through by 1 point?
  4. Volume conviction — was breakout bar volume above its recent daily average?
  5. Time of day       — earlier breakouts tend to capture stronger moves
